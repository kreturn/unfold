### Seismic image unfolding
This repository contains software for automatic seismic image unfolding,
written by Simon Luo and Dave Hale of the Colorado School of Mines.
This software depends on the
[Mines Java Toolkit](https://github.com/dhale/jtk)
and on Dave Hale's repository for
[Seismic image processing for geologic faults](https://github.com/dhale/ipf).
